### 1.family

There are three members in my family. My father is xxx and my mother is an xxx. They were busy when I was a child, so they encouraged me to be independent. They rarely interfered with my life, and they hoped that I could develop freely. They let me make my own choices in both life and study. They hoped that I could become a person who is responsible ，enthusiastic and helpful. And I am working hard to become one.

### 2.**university**

Hunan University is a comprehensive university. It has a long history that can be traced back to Yuelu Academy, which was established more than a thousand years ago. It is located at the foot of Yuelu Mountain, with beautiful scenery and rich cultural atmosphere. Hunan University has many colleges, and it also hosts the Changsha Supercomputer Center, which is one of the most powerful supercomputers in China. Many professors in our university are engaged in research on high-performance computing and parallel computing.

### 3.**ChangSha City**

Changsha is a beautiful city in Hunan Province. It’s a modern and vibrant city with a lot of attractions and entertainment. It has many landmarks, such as the Yuelu Academy and the Orange Island. It is also home to many universities and research institutes, such as Hunan University, Central South University, and National University of Defense Technology.

### 4.**hometown**

### **5.hobbies**

### **6.strengths and weakness**

As for my strongest strength, I am always willing to learn from others and improve myself. Actually, many good habits and methods I learned from the people around me. My another strength is that I have my own planning when I do things. I will set a plan in advance and finish what I have to do diligently.

One of my weaknesses is that I can only focus on one thing at a time that is most important for a period. If I have something important unfinished, I can’t handle many other things at the same time. In addition, I lack confidence a little bit and easy to be nervous in some occasions. I am working hard to correct these weaknesses.

### 7.**favorite courses**

My favorite course is computer systems. In this course, I learned a lot of principles of computer systems, such as program performance optimization, memory hierarchy, linking, and so on. Combined with the operating systems course I took at the same time and the CPU-related knowledge I learned from the digital circuits course before, I gained a deeper understanding of how computer programs run and established the connections among these courses. I enjoyed learning these topics and I hope to continue studying computer system architecture related fileds in the future.

### 8.**algorithm**

**dijikstra**

Dijkstra’s algorithm is a way to find the shortest path between two vertices in a graph. The algorithm works by starting from one vertex, and then expanding a set of vertices that have the shortest distance from it. It always picks the closest vertex to add to the set, and updates the distance to the other vertices. It repeats this process until all the vertics is added to the set.One limitation of Dijkstra’s algorithm is that it only works for graphs that have non-negative edge weights. The time complexity is O(n^2) and can be optimized to O((n+m)logn) if using priority queue and adjacency list.

**quicksort**

Quick sort is a way to sort a list of numbers or other items in a fast and efficient way. The algorithm works by choosing a pivot element from the list, and then partitioning the list into two sublists: one that contains all the elements that are smaller than or equal to the pivot, and one that contains all the elements that are larger than the pivot. Then, the algorithm recursively sorts the two sublists using the same method. When the pivot element is the median of the list, the time complexity is O(nlogn), In the worst case, when the pivot element is always the smallest or the largest element of the list, the time complexity is O(n^2).

**prim\&kruskal**&#x20;

Prim’s algorithm works by starting from one vertex, and then adding the edge with the smallest weight that connects it to another vertex that is not in the tree. It repeats this process until all the vertices are in the tree. Kruskal’s algorithm works by sorting all the edges by their weights, and then adding them one by one to the tree, as long as they do not create a cycle. It repeats this process until all the vertices are in the tree.

### 9.**why choose XXX**

**RUC**

首先，我认为中国人民大学是一个实力很强的学校，在这里读研我可以继续深入研究和学习，得到足够的资源和指导。 其次，我对计算机系统结构方向感兴趣，读了RUC的一位老师的实验室的论文，对这个领域比较感兴趣。 最后，作为一个北方人，未来也希望回北方发展，所以RUC是我很好的一个选择。

I want to apply to Renmin University of China because it is a prestigious university, where I can pursue my research and learning interests with adequate resources and guidance. I am particularly interested in the field of computer system , and I have read one papers from the cloud computing lab.I am interested in this filed and want to learn more. Moreover, as a person who grew up in the north, I have a preference for staying in the north for my future development, and Renmin University of China is an ideal choice for me.

**NJU**

南京大学是实力很强的学校，我觉得在这里读研我可以继续深入研究和学习，得到足够的资源和指导。其次，我对计算机系统相关的内容比较感兴趣，南京大学在软件方面很强，我认为系统软件是一个我考虑研究生时期的方向。此外，南京也是一个很好的地方，未来我也可能考虑来这里发展。

I want to apply to Nanjing University because it is a prestigious university with a lot of resources and guidance for graduate students. I think I can continue to study and research in depth here, and achieve my academic goals.

Secondly, I am interested in computer system related topics, and Nanjing University is very strong in software. I think system software is a direction that I would like to pursue in my graduate studies.

In addition, Nanjing is also a very good place, with a beautiful environment and a vibrant economy. I might also consider developing my career here in the future.

**USTC**

中科大是实力很强的学校，我觉得在这里读研我可以继续深入研究和学习，得到足够的资源和指导。\
其次，我对计算机系统相关的内容比较感兴趣，考虑研究生选择高性能计算方向，科大这里有合肥超算中心，在这方面很强。

I want to apply to the University of Science and Technology of China because it is a prestigious university with abundant resources and guidance for graduate students. Moreover, it has the Hefei Supercomputer Center, which is very attractive to me. I am interested in computer system architecture, especially high-performance computing. I hope to study this topic in depth in my graduate studies.
